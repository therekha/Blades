        `**QUESTIONING**
        The Bluecoats grab an NPC member of your crew or one of the crew's contacts, to question them about your crimes. *Who do the Bluecoats think is most vulnerable?* Make a **fortune roll** to see how much they talk. (1-3: +2 HEAT, 4/5: +1 HEAT), or pay the Bluecoats off with 2 COIN.`,
        `**SHAKEDOWN**
        The Bluecoats make a show of going door to door and roughing up residents of a neighborhood where your crew has influence. Either pay them off with 1 COIN or lose 1 status with the citizenry of the district where the neighborhood is located.`,
        `**POLICE LINE DO NOT CROSS**
        The Bluecoats cordon off one of your **claims** which generates coin. Either persuade them to wrap up their investigation early with a bribe of 2 COIN or you lose the **claim’s** benefit for the following **downtime**. If you have no **claims** like this, you avoid the escalation for now.`

        `**INTERROGATION**
        The Bluecoats round up one of the PCs to question them about the crew’s crimes. How did they manage to capture you? Either pay them off with 3 COIN, or they beat you up (**level 2 harm**) and you tell them what they want to know (+3 HEAT). You can **resist** each of those consequences separately.`,
        `**SEE THIS WARRANT?**
        The Bluecoats raid one of your claims or the establishment of a vice purveyor. Either pay them off with 3 COIN, or lose 2 REP and gain 3 HEAT.`,
        `**TURNING OFF THE TAP**
        An enterprising Magistrate gets creative and manages to cut off a significant source of income for your crew. Pay 6 COIN to cover the shortfall. If you have fewer than 6 COIN, pay the difference in REP.`

        `**INCARCERATED ASSOCIATE**
        One of your cohorts, contacts, or vice purveyors is arrested and hauled off to Ironhook. Clear 3 heat. Pay **coin** equal to double your WANTED LEVEL + 1, or the asset will be unavailable for a number of scores equal to 1d + your WANTED LEVEL.`,
        `**ASSET FORFEITURE**
        The Bluecoats make a move to shrink the borders of your criminal enterprise. Give up a **claim**, or fight back. If you have **no claims, lose 1 hold** instead.`,
        `**ARREST**,
        An Inspector presents a case file of evidence to a magistrate, to begin prosecution of your crew. The Bluecoats send a detail to arrest you (a gang at least equal in scale to your WANTED LEVEL). Pay them off with COIN equal to your WANTED LEVEL +3, hand someone over for arrest (this clears your HEAT), or try to evade capture.`
